`Permutations` generates a variable-length list of permuted integer values from 0 -> (n-1). 

The values are generated by sampling a sine wave at a user-determined frequency; the graph approaches linearity when the sampling frequency nears 2*pi, but displays good (albeit periodic) scatter at other values.

The program is run using a python script `perm.py`. 
This script checks whether a server is running, and if not, starts a local python server. 
The script loads an html page in your default browser. This can be changed to a preferred browser in `perm.py` in the second subprocess.Popen call. 
The program `perm.py` loads data from `perm.html`, an html gui for selecting set length and sampling interval. 
Pressing 'Visualize' communicates with `perm_op.py` via the ajax functionality in jquery. 
This script (`perm_op.py`) generates the data and passes it back to a js dhtml generator within `perm.html`. New content is appended to the document as a graph of the values tabulated by `perm_op.py`. 

To run the program, in the command line, type "python perm.py" inside the directory in which the contents are stored.
