`Permutations` generates a variable-length list of permuted integer values from 0 -> (n-1). 

The values are generated by sampling a sine wave at a user-determined frequency; the graph approaches linearity when the sampling frequency nears 2*pi, but displays good (albeit periodic) scatter at other values.

The program is run using a python script `perm.py`. 

This script checks whether a server is running, and if not, starts a local python server on port 8000. 

The script loads an html page in the default browser. This can be changed to a preferred browser in `perm.py` in the second `subprocess.Popen` call.
 
The program `perm.py` loads data from `perm.html`, an html gui for selecting set length and sampling interval. 

Pressing 'Visualize' sends data to `perm_op.py` via ajax/jquery for processing. 

The script `perm_op.py` generates data and passes it back to a js dhtml generator within `perm.html`. New content is appended to the document as a graph of the values tabulated by `perm_op.py`. 

To run the program, in the command line, type "python perm.py" inside the directory in which the contents are stored.  

`server.py` uses the `requests` module to check for an active server, which is available through `pip` or other avenues.
